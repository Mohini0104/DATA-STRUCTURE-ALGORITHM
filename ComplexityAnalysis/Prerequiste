1. Why we build algorithm?
=> To make things easy 
=> To make some complex problem solvable

2. Apart from the algorithms what else we want from them?
=> We want them to be fast and memory efficient 

3. Multitasking and Multiprocessing - Multitasking is a myth, there's nothing like
multitasking that happens ever, our processor core never handles mult-task at the
  same point of time, 
  Then how we are able to do so many things together?
  => Here comes the concept of core's, ex: dual, octa, hexa ...
   Techically at one point of time we can run only one program at a time in a single core
   and if we have multicore let's say we have 8 cores that means in actual we can run 8 programs in parallel
   and that's called multiprocessing.

4. GPU => Grapical Processing Unit

5. Performance of CPU depends on : CPU + RAM + Cache

6. Multithreading: 

7. Slow performance of a system should not be the judging criteria for algorithms
