 1. What is an asymptot?
 => If we have a curve then asymptot is the line that intersect the curve at infinity

Asymptotic analysis is called so because we assume  the input size is going to grow at a very significant rate 
and this will be a very high value

-> Asymptotic analysis generally analyses your algorithm in 3 major categories
1. Worst 2. Average 3. Best

1. Worst: This analysis defines the input for which the algo takes the longest time
Here the algo is slowest
3. Best: This analysis defines the input for which the algo takes the least time
Here the algo is fastest
2. Averge:
